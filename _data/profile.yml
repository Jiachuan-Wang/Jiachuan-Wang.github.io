    If the brain is akin to a planet, there are a multitude of unknown territories yet to be explored. At the crux of understanding the brain is one's knowledge of the various functions and processes that allow it to operate. I am deeply fascinated by <b>neuroscience</b> and driven to apply multidisciplinary approaches to unravel these complexities.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research centers on investigating the <b>neurocomputational mechanisms</b> underlying cognition, with the broader goal of building a <b>model of the mind</b>. This work ranges from decoding fMRI data using machine learning techniques to modeling <b>learning and memory</b> through behavioral experiments.

    I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the National University of Singapore under the guidance of <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/lsi/principal-investigators-3/dr-andrew-tan-yong-yi/">Andrew Tan</a>, <a href="https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/people/libedinsky-camilo/">Camilo Libedinsky</a>, and <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/edic/staff/yen-shih-cheng/">Shih-Cheng Yen</a>. I hold dual B.Sc. degrees in Biomedical Informatics from Zhejiang University and the University of Edinburgh, where I completed my thesis on multi-voxel pattern analysis of human memory and emotions under the supervision of <a href="https://discovery-brain-sciences.ed.ac.uk/our-staff/research-groups/gedi-luksys">Gedi Lukšys</a>. I also conducted a research training project under <a href="http://www.ziint.zju.edu.cn/Anna/index.php/Index/index1.html">Anna Wang Roe</a>, where I contributed to experiments, data analysis, and visualization of Infrared Neural Stimulation (INS) with fMRI.
  </p>
  <p>
    My current work is focused on developing biologically plausible models of spatial learning and associative memory.
