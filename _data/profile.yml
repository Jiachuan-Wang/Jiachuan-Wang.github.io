    <b>Learning and memory</b> allow animals to adapt to dynamic environments, but how do different <b>neural substrates</b> contribute to these processes? How do molecular and physiological factors, along with individual differences, shape the <b>acquisition</b> and <b>exploitation</b> of knowledge? To explore these questions, I develop interpretable <b>computational models</b> grounded in theory and experimental data to explain and predict cognitive states and behaviors.

    I am currently a Ph.D. student at the National University of Singapore, where I study biologically plausible models of spatial learning and associative memory under the supervision of <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/lsi/principal-investigators-3/dr-andrew-tan-yong-yi/">Andrew Tan</a>, <a href="https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/people/libedinsky-camilo/">Camilo Libedinsky</a>, and <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/edic/staff/yen-shih-cheng/">Shih-Cheng Yen</a>. Previously, I contributed to fMRI research on human memory with <a href="https://discovery-brain-sciences.ed.ac.uk/our-staff/research-groups/gedi-luksys">Gedi Lukšys</a> and the monkey connectome with <a href="http://www.ziint.zju.edu.cn/Anna/index.php/Index/index1.html">Anna Wang Roe</a>.
