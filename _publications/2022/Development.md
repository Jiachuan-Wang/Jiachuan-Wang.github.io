abstract: >-
  We demonstrate that the UBE4B-KLHL22 E3 ubiquitin ligase cascade regulates mTOR activity in neurodevelopment. Deletion of UBE4B causes upregulation of KLHL22 and hyperactivation of mTOR, leading to defective proliferation and differentiation of neural precursor cells. Suppression of KLHL22 expression reverses the elevated activity of mTOR caused by acute local deletion of UBE4B. Prenatal treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin rescues neurogenesis defects in Ube4b mutant mice.
