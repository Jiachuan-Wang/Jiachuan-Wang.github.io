abstract: >-
  I conducted brain mapping and multi-voxel pattern analysis on the emotional dimensions and memory retrieval performance in the picture task through brain region information from real data and the meta-analysis database Neuorsynth. The results reveal the neural basis of emotion and memory-related phenotypes distributed in cortical areas and the bias toward subcortical components of the limbic system in previous studies, which has a cautionary implication on regions of interest selection in neuroimaging research.
