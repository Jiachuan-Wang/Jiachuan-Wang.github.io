  #Decision-making occurs during navigation and learning. It is widely studied in choice behaviors, but less well understood in natural and more continuous settings, especially under stress and uncertainty. This process could be investigated in rodent spatial navigation, which has been modeled with place-cell-based models. However, traditional models usually ignored detailed trajectories or kinematics. Here we extended a place cell-based reinforcement learning model to include detailed kinematics and used it to investigate the role of motivational stress in Morris Water Maze. We performed experiments with two strains of mice learning two versions of the task under different water temperatures: the task with a fixed platform location and the task where platform location varied randomly between two positions. Using computational modeling and parameter estimation, we were able to not only reproduce detailed mouse behaviors but also reveal computational correlates of temperature-based behavioral differences. We then extended the model to include a wall-distance-based component, where spatial learning would be guided not just by place information but also by a cue-like signal -- distance to the wall, which reproduced mouse behavior in tasks with uncertain platform positions better than place-cell-based strategies alone. Based on that, we further implemented a more biologically plausible model that uses a combination of border (boundary) cells and place cells. We finally compared the performance of models with only place cells, place and distance cells, and place and border cells in different experimental conditions and genetic strains of mice and performed parameter estimation to find the best-fitting model settings and parameters for each animal. Our findings provide insights into computational mechanisms underlying spatial navigation in mice and how various modulators influence it.
